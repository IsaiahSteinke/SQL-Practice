# Set working directory

# Load datasets/tables
# We'll retain the full table names to practice aliasing. Further, we will keep
# the default setting for "stringsAsFactors = FALSE" in read.csv(). Hence, I
# won't explicitly call this option/flag.

# This query takes awhile to run (108.62 s), although it's only using one
# core/thread on my computer. This is most likely because it's calculating
# a lot of distances that it doesn't need to in "worldcitycoords" (we're only
# interested in capital cities, after all). Further, there are some redundant
# entries in the output since the precision of the latitude and longitude
# is not very high (only whole numbers). Thus, some capitals have more than one
# other capital/city that is the same distance away. Finally, there are also
# some errors, e.g., Belize, Belize is not a capital city. (For these errors,
# I'm thinking that I don't have enough constraints on some of the subqueries.)

# I'm guessing that it would be better to first construct a table of capital
# cities and their coordinates from "worldcitycoords" and "countries" and then
# use that table to calculate distances to find the closest capital city.
