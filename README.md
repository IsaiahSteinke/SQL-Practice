# SQL-Practice
The repository contains scripts in various languages with SQL queries as practice.

## Datasets
The datasets are taken from a homework set for one of the classes of my Master's program. The homework consisted of various SQL queries done in SAS, most of which I have replicated and modified in the various scripts. The datasets originate from the `sql.cpo` file in `data`. I wrote a SAS script (`src/extract_data.sas`) to extract the datasets from this proprietary SAS format and save the tables as CSV files.
